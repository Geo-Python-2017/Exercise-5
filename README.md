# Exercise-5: Data analysis with Pandas 

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand how to use [Pandas - Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
to do some basic data analysis and data manipulations. In this week's exercise you are asked to analyze
temperature data from Helsinki (in Southern Finland) and Utsjoki (northest municipality in Finland)
and to explore how their summers have differed in 2016.

After making your changes, you will need to upload your files to GitHub. The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where asked or at the end of this document in the section titled Answers.

## Problem 1

Find out some basic statistics:

- Read in the data
- How many rows does the data have?

- What is the mean Fahrenheit temperature for the whole dataset?


## Problem 2

Similarly as in earlier exercises the temperatures are represented in Fahrenheit, hence, you need to convert the temperatures into Celsius. Then you need to analyze the data and find out
